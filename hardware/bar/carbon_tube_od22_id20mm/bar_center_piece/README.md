# Central Piece for 22m tube

Central piece for a **22mm** carbon tube — Variant 7.

Variant 7 is the result of many design iterations focused on:
- Robustness
- Aesthetics
- Minimal offset from the bar center
- Reliable securing of heat-shrink tubing

## Notes on Versions

The central piece comes in two versions based on the bolt size:

| Version | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| 2.5mm Bolt | Most compact design, optimized for lightweight and minimal size | Recommended for 22mm tube with short, joystick-style bars |
| 3mm Bolt | Slightly bulkier, more robust version | Use if maximum durability is preferred over compactness |

Choose the version based on your design priorities — compact vs. robust.

## Assembly Instructions

Refer to the `README.md` for the 24mm central piece version for general assembly guidelines.  
Most of the assembly steps are identical except for specific adjustments due to tube diameter and bolt size.

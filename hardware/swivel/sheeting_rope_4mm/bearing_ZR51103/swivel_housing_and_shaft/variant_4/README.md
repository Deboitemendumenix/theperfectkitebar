# Swivel

A standard component of any kite control bar — designed to prevent flying lines from twisting during use.

This swivel is optimized for:
- **4mm Dyneema** main sheeting line (inside a Dyneema chafe sleeve suitable for 4–6mm rope)
- **2.5mm safety line** (non-bungee type)

## 3D Printing Instructions

Both the **swivel housing** and **swivel shaft** are designed to be 3D printed from **316 stainless steel** using **SLM technology (Selective Laser Melting)**.

---

### Material & Technology
- Material: **316 Stainless Steel**  
- Printing Method: **SLM (Selective Laser Melting)**

> SLM is a metal 3D printing technology that uses a high-power laser to fully melt metal powder, layer by layer, into solid parts. It produces highly durable and functional metal components suitable for structural applications.

## Printing Notes
- Recommended print orientation: minimize support contact on critical surfaces.  
- Consider post-processing (vibratory polishing or manual smoothing) for smoother line contact areas.  
- Ensure correct tolerances for bearing fit.  
- Clean all support removal points carefully.

---

## Assembly Notes
- Insert the ceramic bearing carefully into the swivel housing.  
- The bearing should seat snugly without forcing.  
- Ensure smooth rotation after assembly.

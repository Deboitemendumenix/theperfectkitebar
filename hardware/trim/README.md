# V-Splitter

The **V-Splitter** is an essential part of the trim system. It connects the **main depower (trim) line** to the two **front flying lines**, creating a so called low V-split.

This V-splitter design features a **top horizontal part** where the front lines attach. When the top of the V-splitter sits **perfectly horizontal** (assuming kite is at 12 o'clock), it visually confirms that the **back (power) lines have been trimmed to equal length**, ensuring precise and symmetrical trim. This makes trim or not trim decision easy if you see that v-splitter is side-ways - probably is good idea to trim.

This project supports **only 4mm sheeting rope** throughout — ensuring compatibility, low weight, and modularity across all bar components. See note below about splitter for 8mm sheeting rope.

## Supported Design (TPKB Standard)

The following V-Splitter variants are recommended for use with ThePerfectKiteBar system:

| Sheeting Rope | Front Line | Variant | Technology | Material | Files | Preview |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|----------|-------|---------|
| 4mm           | 1.4mm      | 3       | MJF        | PA12     | [`Files`](sheeting_rope_4mm/front_line_1.4mm/v-splitter/variant_3) | ![v-splitter](sheeting_rope_4mm/front_line_1.4mm/v-splitter/variant_3/v-splitter_4x14_mjf.png) |
| 4mm           | 1.7mm      | 3       | MJF        | PA12     | [`Files`](sheeting_rope_4mm/front_line_1.7mm/v-splitter/variant_3) | ![v-splitter](sheeting_rope_4mm/front_line_1.7mm/v-splitter/variant_3/v-splitter_4x17_mjf.png) |

## Optional / Legacy Compatibility

The following variant is **not part of this system** but provided as an often hard to get replacement part for off-the-shelf bars that use thicker rope and front lines.

| Sheeting Rope | Front Line | Variant | Technology | Material | Files |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|----------|-------|
| 8mm           | 2mm        | 3       | MJF        | PA12     | [`Files`](sheeting_rope_8mm/front_line_2mm/v-splitter/variant_3) |

> ⚠️ Use only if you are adapting the V-splitter for a different bar system.  
> This is not compatible with the TPKB bar or trim system at the moment.

## Material & Printing Guidelines

- **Technology:** Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) strongly recommended as this is a critical part
- **Material:** PA12 HP Nylon (UV-resistant and tested in harsh conditions)
- **Coloring:** Optional, default grey or black; dyeing not required

---

## Assembly Notes

- Mounts inline between front lines and depower line
- Position correctly so that safety line (through hole) is aligned with the cleat base
